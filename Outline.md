# 3DPrintCopterX

This project aims to develop a drone prototype using 3D printing and consumer/hobbyist hardware.

## Initial Design

The design philosophy for this project is to design 3D-printed parts to accommodate the hardware and provide an initial frame for the motors. The frame may be further strengthened by aluminium sheet-metal.

## Hardware
The following hardware is used for the prototype:
- CUAV V5 Nano Flight Controller
- CUAV NEO v2 GPS Antenna

## Step-by-step
