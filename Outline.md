# 3DPrintCopterX

This project aims to develop a drone prototype using 3D printing and consumer/hobbyist hardware.

## Initial Design

The design philosophy for this project is to design 3D-printed parts to accommodate the hardware and provide an initial frame for the motors. The frame may be further strengthened by aluminium sheet-metal.

## Hardware

A Creality Ender 3 v2 FDM 3D Printer is used to print parts.

The following hardware is used for the prototype:
- CUAV V5 Nano Flight Controller
- CUAV NEO v2 GPS Antenna
- T-Motor Air Gear 450

## CAD

Autodesk Inventor is the software used for modelling due to the author's familiarity. FreeCAD was also considered due to its similarity, capabilities, and wider availability.

## SITL Testing

Ardupilot Mission Planner, and X-Plane 11
